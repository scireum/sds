                <p>
                    SDS is a tool to ease deployment of software components across low bandwidth connections. Performing
                    differential updates, only files which really changed are transmitted. Using port 80 and HTTP enables
                    updates through most firewalls etc. without exotic configuration.<br />

                </p>
                <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
                <p>
                    SDS consists of two parts: A command line tool calles <b>sds</b> and the <b>sds-server</b>. To use
                    it you need to obtain the appropriate binary for your platform (see left). Having a bash at
                    hands, this can easily be done using <code>wget -O /usr/local/bin/sds &lt;BINARY-URL&gt;</code>. Having downloaded
                    the binary, you need to make it executable by calling <code>chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sds</code>.
                    You can call <code>sds usage</code> to get a complete list of all commands and environment variables
                    which can be set. (Like SDS_SERVER, so that you don't need to specify the <b>-server</b> parameter
                    for each call.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now you can start using sds to install your own <b>sds-server</b> (or other artifacts, like
                    <a href="http://s3ninja.net" target="_blank">S3 Ninja</a>).
                    Calling <code>sds -server http://sds.scireum.net remote</code> you'll get a list of all public
                    artifacts on our main distribution server. In a <b>new and empty</b> directory, you can call
                    <code>sds -server http://sds.scireum.net pull sds-server</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <div class="alert">Never call this in a directory filled with data, as it will delete everything which does not belong to the
                        sds distribution!</div>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like any <a target="_blank" href="http://sirius-lib.net">SIRIUS</a> system you can now start the server by calling
                    <code>./sirius.sh start</code> in the install directory (you might need to make it executable: <code>chmod +x sirius.sh</code>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    By default the system operates on port 9000. You can tweak the configuration by creating a file called
                    <code>instance.conf</code>. Here you can place custom settings like <code>http.port=80</code>. All available
                    settings can be found in <code>app/application.conf</code>, <code>app/component-web.conf</code> and <code>app/component-kernel.conf</code>.
